# character-classification

## Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a classification up for hand drawn characters of the the Cyrillic, Hiragana and Katakana alphabets. 

I trained CNNs with and without data augmentation for the various hand drawn characters considered acheiving aroun 97-99\% validation accuracy.
I built a streamlit app allowing a user to practice drawing various characters with the CNN giving a prediction for the top 3 most likely characters 
drawn. 

## Motivation

The motivation for this project came from the fact that I personally spent some time learning these alphabets given my passion for languages
and the fact that I am working on a Japanese experiment.
